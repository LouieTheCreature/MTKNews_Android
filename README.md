Update : MTK News for Android (Alpha) is now on the Play Store!
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=louiethecreature.projectBlackWhite

Latest build info
---------------------------------
###### Current Stage : Alpha 2
###### Current Build : 15
###### Current Version : 1.0_Build15

"Backend"
--------------------------
github.com/louiethecreature/projectblackwhite is the repo where the "backend" is stored , these JSON files include the content the app requires to run and some latest build/version info, every version of this JSON is used in specific builds, it's always recommended to use builds which connect to the latest version to get the latest posts and updates.

Privacy
--------------------------
The MTK News app doesn't collect any data, the connection to the "backend" repo is one-way and the app can't send anything to it, all the settings in the app are stored on the device and not on the cloud.

Important alpha notes
----------------------------
1- Bugs: These builds are extremely buggy at the moment, expect bugs and under construction signs reoccurring a lot in the UI, if you encounter a bug, please report it here if it’s not already a known issue.

2- Content issues: Don’t expect the latest articles to appear fast in these builds, these are testing builds and are more focused on the app itself rather than the content within it, new articles may arrive in a few minutes or may take several days, or they may appear only on newer builds, this can also apply to other parts of the app.

3- The builds expiring and having to upgrade: Test builds expire after a period of time and they become unusable, so please upgrade to the latest builds once they come out.

4- Compatibility: Although MTK News for Android should work on any Android device higher than Android 8 , It’s still possible that you’ll encounter compatibility issues.
